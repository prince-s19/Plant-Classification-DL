# 🌿 Plant Classification Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify plant species using transfer learning.

## 📘 Notebook
- `Prince-Task3.ipynb`

## 🌱 Plant Classes
- Celosia Argentea L
- Purple Chloris
- Crowfoot Grass

## 🧠 Model Details
- Architecture: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Input Size: 224×224
- Real Validation Accuracy: **94.74%**

## 🧪 Testing
The trained model was tested using unseen plant images uploaded during runtime, and it correctly classified the plant with high confidence.

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset is not uploaded due to size limitations.
Expected folder structure:

Plant_Dataset/
├── CELOSIA ARGENTEA L/
├── PURPLE CHLORIS/
└── CROWFOOT GRASS/


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `Prince-Task3.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset
3. Run all cells
4. Upload a test image to see prediction
